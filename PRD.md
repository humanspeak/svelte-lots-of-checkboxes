# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## One-Million-Checkboxes in Svelte, Powered by Cloudflare

---

### 1. Overview & Purpose

The goal is to create a **Svelte-based** clone of [One Million Checkboxes](https://github.com/nolenroyalty/one-million-checkboxes/) using a fully serverless and edge-focused architecture on **Cloudflare**. This project aims to demonstrate:

1. **Reliability and scalability** of Cloudflare’s serverless platform.
2. **Efficiency** in delivering a massive grid of selectable checkboxes.
3. **Stateful data updates** with minimal latency and maximum concurrency.
4. **Security** with out-of-the-box Cloudflare solutions to protect from spam and other abuse.

We aim to showcase how a **Cloudflare-first** product can be built by a senior engineer to handle real-time user interactions at the edge, without any self-hosted servers.

---

### 2. Project Goals

1. **Fully Serverless:** No self-hosted or traditional backend servers.
2. **Edge-First:** High performance, minimal latency for reads/writes.
3. **Massive Grid of Checkboxes:** Achieve the same or expanded functionality as the original project (up to one million checkboxes).
4. **Scalability:** Handle concurrent operations from hundreds or thousands of users.
5. **Resilience & Security:** Ensure data consistency, avoid collisions, and mitigate spam or DoS attempts.
6. **Modern UI & Design System:** A polished user experience in Svelte with minimal overhead and quick load times; optionally leveraging design standards inspired by **shadcn** (see [Design Approach & shadcn section](#shadcn)).

---

### 3. Project Scope

#### In-Scope

1. **Application Frontend**
   - Written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
   - Single-page or minimal-page interface.
   - Renders the grid of up to one million checkboxes - needs to happen in a lazy fashion.

2. **Cloudflare Integration**
   - **Cloudflare Pages** to host static Svelte assets.
   - **Cloudflare Workers** for the backend logic (API endpoints) handling reads/writes of checkbox states.
   - **Durable Objects or KV** for concurrency control and state management.
   - **Cloudflare Turnstile** for spam/abuse prevention.
   - **Cloudflare Analytics** for performance and usage insights.

3. **Real-Time Data Updates**
   - Users see immediate updates when toggling a checkbox.
   - Potential concurrency solutions to prevent stale data or collisions.

4. **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Automated deployment via Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Actions.

#### Out of Scope

1. **Non-Cloudflare Hosting:** We will not host via AWS, Azure, GCP, or any self-managed environments.
2. **Complex Authentication/Authorization:** Beyond basic spam/abuse prevention, we won’t require user accounts.

### 4. Requirements

#### 4.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Checkbox Grid**
   - Display up to one million checkboxes in an efficient manner.
   - Each checkbox can be toggled on/off.
   - Persistent state across sessions and geographies.

2. **State Management**
   - Toggling a checkbox issues an update request to Cloudflare Workers.
   - The updated state is immediately reflected for all users (within an acceptable near real-time range).

3. **Analytics & Logs**
   - Capture metrics such as number of toggles, unique IP addresses, and timestamp of toggles.
   - Possibly store these logs in Workers KV or another analytics solution for display.

4. **Spam/Abuse Prevention**
   - Implement Cloudflare Turnstile to verify user interactions if necessary.
   - Rate-limiting or IP-based throttling for excessive toggles.

#### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Page load time under 50ms on a typical broadband connection.
   - Smooth rendering of the checkbox grid, using chunked/lazy loading.

2. **Scalability**
   - Able to handle thousands of concurrent toggles.
   - No single point of failure in the architecture (Durable Objects, Workers, and KV must be used properly).

3. **Reliability**
   - Consistent state updates without data loss or corruption.
   - Automatic failover or fallback in case of ephemeral Worker issues.

4. **Security**
   - Mitigate large-scale spamming or DDoS.
   - Protect state from unintended overwrites or malicious manipulation.

---

### 5. Proposed Architecture & Approach

1. **Frontend (Svelte)**
   - Built as a single-page app (SPA).
   - Hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** for global edge delivery.
   - Interacts with Cloudflare Workers via WebSockets.

2. **Backend (Cloudflare Workers & Durable Objects)**
   - **Cloudflare Workers:**
     - Lightweight API routes for reading/writing checkbox states.
     - Potential integration point for Turnstile-based CAPTCHA checks.
   - **Durable Objects:**
     - Provide a single consistent concurrency model.
     - Could store the state of the checkboxes in memory + an external durable storage.
     - Manage locking, coordinate updates, and track usage analytics.

3. **Data Storage**
   - **Option A:** **Cloudflare Workers KV**
     - Simple key-value store.
     - Good for storing aggregated data or simpler indexing (checkbox ID → state).
     - Eventually consistent, but extremely quick for reads.
   - **Option B:** **Durable Objects**
     - In-memory state for concurrency, with checkpoint writes to KV or another store.
     - More robust concurrency control at the object level.

4. **Spam/Abuse Prevention**
   - **Cloudflare Turnstile** for human verification if toggling is too frequent.
   - Rate-limiting suspicious IP addresses via Worker logic.

5. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Hosted in a GitHub repository.
   - On commit to main branch, Cloudflare Pages automatically builds and deploys the Svelte app.
   - Workers code automatically deployed via GitHub Actions or integrated in the same Pages project.

6. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - **Cloudflare Web Analytics** for page visits.
   - Worker logs or debug logs to track toggles.
   - Durable Objects logging to confirm concurrency performance.

### 6. Cloudflare Tools & Services Breakdown

1. **Cloudflare Pages**
   - Serve the static Svelte-built site from the edge.
   - Integrates seamlessly with GitHub for CI/CD.

2. **Cloudflare Workers**
   - Provide serverless compute for REST endpoints and logic handling.
   - Minimal cold start times.
   - Scales automatically at the edge.

3. **Durable Objects**
   - Single-threaded concurrency for each object.
   - Manage global state distribution for the checkbox data.

4. **Workers KV**
   - Key-value store for storing checkbox states or aggregated counts.
   - Fast, eventually consistent global reads.

5. **Cloudflare Turnstile**
   - Provide CAPTCHA-like verification for suspicious activity.

6. **Cloudflare Analytics**
   - Real-time monitoring of requests, usage patterns, performance.

7. **Optional: Cloudflare D1 (Beta)**
   - SQL database at the edge if a relational schema is required.

### 7. Design Approach & shadcn

- For a clean and modern UI design, we will **take inspiration from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**.
  - shadcn/ui is a popular design system built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI (primarily for React).
  - While it’s React-focused, we can use its principles, styling, and general look-and-feel to guide our Svelte styling approach.
  - **Key elements** such as color schemes, typography, and spacing can be replicated in Svelte with Tailwind or other utility-first frameworks.
  - The objective is to have a consistent, modern UI pattern for the checkboxes, overlays, dialogs, etc.

---

### 8. User Stories & Use Cases

1. **User Checks a Box**
   - A user visits the site, sees the grid, clicks on one checkbox.
   - The site calls the Worker’s API to update the state.
   - Response is returned indicating success; the UI updates accordingly.

2. **Concurrent Users**
   - Multiple users in different parts of the world toggle checkboxes.
   - Durable Objects or KV ensures updates are accurate and consistent.
   - The site displays near real-time state changes.

3. **Spam Attempt**
   - A user/bot tries to programmatically toggle thousands of checkboxes in seconds.
   - Rate limiting and/or Turnstile triggers, limiting potential abuse.

4. **High-Traffic Event**
   - The site goes viral. Thousands of toggles happen concurrently.
   - The Worker architecture and global distribution scales automatically.

---

### 9. Potential Risks & Mitigation

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Mitigation:** Use Durable Objects efficiently; partition data if necessary to avoid single-object contention.

2. **Eventual Consistency in KV**
   - **Mitigation:** Use Durable Objects for near-real-time updates and/or ephemeral memory for immediate updates.

3. **Spam & Abuse**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement Turnstile, IP-based throttling, and edge firewall rules.

4. **Large State Storage**
   - With up to one million checkboxes, data can get large.
   - **Mitigation:** Use pagination/lazy loading in the UI. Store states efficiently in KV or a partitioned set of Durable Objects.

5. **Rate Limits**
   - Cloudflare Workers have certain daily and concurrency limits.
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor usage carefully, and potentially upgrade the plan if usage is very high.
